Changelog v2.1:

- reduced default door trigger radius to 3 meters
- if scriptHandle_automatedDoors is terminated, all related triggers and actions will be removed
- door actions will be readded upon respawn
- scriptHandle_automatedDoors is broadcast to the clients, because it's needed for creating/removing the actions
  -> terminating the script client side does not affect the script server side
- a few minor changes
